						<h3>The Rules of Dixit :</h3>
						<span class="bold">Phase 1 : </span>The StoryTeller chooses one of his cards and gives you a hint to recognize it.<br/>
						<span class="bold">Phase 2 : </span>All other players choose a card of their own that could also match the hint.<br/>
						<span class="bold">Phase 3 : </span>All cards are now shuffled and revealed : the players have to find the card of the StoryTeller.<br/>
						The goal for the StoryTeller is that some people will find his card, but not all of them. 
						He his <em>completely free</em> on the hint and the informations he gives, but he should obviously try 
						to make it neither too obvious nor too obscure.<br/>
						<h4>The points :</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span class="bold">3pts</span> for the StoryTeller if some but not all players find his card (0pts otherwise)
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="bold">2pts</span> if you find the card of the StoryTeller
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="bold">1pt</span> per player who voted for your card instead of the one of the StoryTeller
							</li>

						<h3>Send us your own custom cards :</h3>
						Please make sure your card is vertical with a 2/3 ratio. <span class="bold">500x750</span> pixels is a good size.<br/>
						Also make sure you have all the rights on the image ^^<br/>
						Then send at <a href="mailto:jules.fouchy@ntymail.com">jules.fouchy@ntymail.com</a> either :
						<ul>
							<li>
								Your image in <em>png</em> or <em>jpeg</em> format
							</li>
							<li>
								A p5 script. It will be run each time the card is drawn and if it involves some randomness the card will be different each round !
							</li>
							<li>
								A fragment shader written in glsl (feature coming soon)
							</li>
							<li>
								Got another way of doing art ? <a href="mailto:jules.fouchy@ntymail.com">Get in touch with me</a> and I might implement it !
